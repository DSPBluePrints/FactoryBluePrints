## Introduction

This is a blueprint repository for the game [**Dyson Sphere Program**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/_/), created to store and share community-made factory blueprints.

The first batch of blueprints was mainly contributed by members of **小马蓝图群** and [**CIDT 设科院**](https://dspcidt.cn/). To better categorize, manage, store, and share the large volume of community blueprints, we plan to use GitHub as a backup for the QQ group file collections—and potentially grow this project into a dedicated blueprint website in the future.

You can join the QQ groups and upload blueprints to group files. We will periodically sort and upload those blueprints to this repository. If anything is missing, feel free to remind us in the groups. You can also contribute via Pull Request—please submit to the most appropriate folder based on the blueprint’s purpose.

Besides GitHub, you can also reach us via QQ groups:

## How to Use This Repository

> This repository includes Git and an automatic update script, so you can use it normally even without any prior Git knowledge.

### First Download

1. Open the repository homepage on GitHub: [https://github.com/DSPBluePrints/FactoryBluePrints](https://github.com/DSPBluePrints/FactoryBluePrints)
2. Go to → [**Releases**](https://github.com/DSPBluePrints/FactoryBluePrints/releases) ← and download the latest blueprint pack. The file name should look like `FactoryBluePrints_X.Y.Z.rar`. **Do not** download **Source code** from the green **Code** button—those files are **not complete**.
3. Extract the archive, then place the **entire folder** into the game’s default blueprint directory, just like any other blueprint pack. After placing it, it should look like: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Dyson Sphere Program\Blueprint\FactoryBluePrints\README.md`
4. **You must run an update once before first use—otherwise, there will be no blueprints yet.**

### Update

1. Just double-click: `update.bat`

## FAQ

> Q: Why can’t I open the repository page / why is downloading slow / why is updating slow?
> A: This is usually a network issue. Since the repository is hosted on GitHub, you can enable GitHub acceleration in [Watt Toolkit](https://steampp.net) (formerly Steam++). ~~Or magic?~~

> Q: Warning: “It looks like you installed to the wrong path. This may cause permission issues.”
> A: This usually happens when you extract the archive and copy **all files** directly into `Blueprint`, instead of copying the **whole folder** into `Blueprint`. The repository does not rely on absolute paths, but that doesn’t mean Git has permission to read/write in every location. On some systems, Git may not have access to the `Blueprint` root directory.
